h1: Eco friendly products - new consumption trend!
---

It's high time for all of us to consider our footprint and ability to reduce the waste and its effects on the environment. This can only be done by making a conscious decision of using eco friendly products. We also need to try and find out exactly how the products we use are produced and what exactly is in them. This will force companies to create environmentally friendly products.

Eco-friendly products are products that are not harmful to the environment. These are products made from organic and all-natural ingredients. They also come in recyclable compostable, or biodegradable packaging. Let’s take a look at all the eco friendly products that you can start using as soon as today and save the environment while at it.

1. Eco-friendly products for the kitchen. Every day we use many items that can be replaced with eco friendly, for example:

    1. Reusable Snack Bags.  
        Reduce the amount of plastic in your home by replacing plastic Ziploc bags with reusable products such as reusable snack bags.One good brand is the Stasher Snack Bags. These bags are Lead-free, PVC free, BPA free, phthalates free, and vinyl free.

    2. Reusable grocery bags  
        The amount of waste collected from shopping bags is scary. Stop this waste by using reusable grocery bags.

    3. Reusable non-plastic meal prep containers  
        Instead of adding more plastic to the environment try using glass meal prep containers for your meals.

2. Eco Friendly Water Bottles & Coffee Cups.

    1. Reusable Water Bottles  
        Take around right now and you're likely to see a water bottle laying around. Instead of buying water every time you need to quench your thirst, buy a reusable water bottle and reduce the use of plastic around the world.
    
    2. Stainless Steel Water Bottle  
        Use a durable, non-disposable water bottle for all your daily water needs.

    3. Thermo Coffee Cup  
        Carrying a cup of coffee from home will not only save you money but nature will love you for it. If you still want to have your coffee from your favorite coffee shop then have them pack it in a reusable coffee cup.

3. Eco Friendly Products For The Home 

    1. LED light bulbs  
        LED light bulbs are one of the most eco friendly products you'll find around. They convert 95% of the energy used into light and only 5% is wasted as heat. This makes them way more energy efficient than traditional lighting options. LEDs also use much less power saving you money.

    2. Timer for your water heater  
        How many times have you forgotten to turn off your water heater? Countless I imagine. Thank god for timers! Get a timer that will automatically turn off your heater when you are not at home or at night? Not sure which timer to buy? Intermatic T104 Electromechanical Timer is a great option. You can set it to turn your heater on and off as you please.
    
    3. Eco Friendly bath towels  
        Another great green product addition to your home is eco friendly Chakir Turkish Linens bath towels. These towels are made from 35% bamboo fiber, are chemical-free and contain only natural dyes. In addition, they are affordable and feel great on your skin.
